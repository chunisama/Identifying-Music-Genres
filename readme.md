# Genre Identification: A Music Genre Visualization

## Overview
Currently, there are 2881 genres of music known to man. Spotify and Every Noise at Once have published data that reflects songs by their different attributes such as valence, tempo, danceability, energy, loudness, speechness, instrumentalness, key, etc. With the umbrella attribute over each song, as their parent genre. Genre Identification highlights all 2801 genres using a sample song's attributes to compare the key differences or similarities of every music genre known to humankind.

## Functionality & MVP
Genre Identification users are able to:
* View a broad overview of every music genre known to human ears
* Compare each genre to a it's corresponding song's attributes like energy, danceability, tempo, valence, tempo, instrumentalness, etc
* User will be able to toggle between each song attribute to visualize key differences and similarities between each genre
* User is able to play song to hear a sample of the genre using spotify api..?

## Architecture & Technologies
Genre Identification is built with:
* Javascript
* `D3.js` + `HTML` + `CSS3`
* Webpack & Babel
* Additional technologies I have to figure out...

## Wireframe
This visualization will consist of a single screen containing an interactive graph that maps each song to its genre on the x axis. There wil a panel to refine and toggle the data by a song's attributes. Tentatively, a music player on the right of the interactive graph. Additionally, there will be links to Github and Linkedin at the footer.
