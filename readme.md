# Genre Identifier: A Music Genre Visualization

Currently, there are 2880+ genres of music known to man. Spotify and Every Noise at Once have published data that reflects songs by their different attributes such as valence, tempo, danceability, energy, loudness, speechness, instrumentalness, key, etc. With the umbrella attribute over each song, as their parent genre. Genre Identifier highlights a subset of 625 genres using a sample song's attributes to compare the key differences or similarities of every music genre known to humankind.

Genre Identification is built with:
* `Javascript`
* `D3.js` + `HTML` + `CSS3`
* `Webpack` & `Babel`


## Wireframe
This visualization will consist of a single screen containing an interactive graph that maps each song to its genre on the x axis. There will a button panel to refine and toggle the data by a song's attributes. Additionally, there will be links to Github and Linkedin underneath my button container.
